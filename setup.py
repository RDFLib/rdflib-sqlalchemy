    SQLAlchemy store formula-aware implementation.
    It stores its triples in the following partitions:

    * Asserted non rdf:type statements
    * Asserted rdf:type statements (in a table which models Class membership).
      The motivation for this partition is primarily improved query speed and
      scalability as most graphs will always have more rdf:type statements than
      others.
    * All Quoted statements

    In addition it persists namespace mappings in a separate table
